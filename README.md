To build the mine field is necessary use the matrix.
Each positon in this matrix represents a postion on the field.
Each field has atributs that indicates if that field has mine, was flaged,
was clicked and has mine arround.

possible actions are:
new_game - start the game, you can define number of rows, columns and mines on the field
flag_positon - you put a flag in that position
click_position - you click in that position and there is no mine arround you clear that area until arrive near a mine.


Exemple field where zero is just position on field and 9 position of mine: \
